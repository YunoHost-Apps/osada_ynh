**Osada** is a **social networking** platform specifically designed to be the glue that binds much of the **decentralised** web in a way that has not been **possible before**. It does this not by magic, but by **“speaking the language” of the various decentralised networks** and acting as a translator to pass information between them. Using Osada, you can seamlessly connect and share with your contacts whether they have an account on a Hubzilla server, a Mastodon server, or any of several popular platforms on the open web.
